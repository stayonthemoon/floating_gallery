# Floating Image Gallery

A simple interactive image gallery with floating animation.

## Thoughts

As it is a pretty hard animation, there are comments left, how it works and which function does what. But I'm note sure this gallery might be usefull in real life projects, cause it takes pretty bit amont of memory (code). So it's just a playing around with JS "project".
